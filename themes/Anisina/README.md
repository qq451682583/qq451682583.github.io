#### Comment

This theme support both Disqus and Duoshuo as the third party discussion system.

First, you need to sign up and get your own account. Repeat, DO NOT use mine! (I have set Trusted Domains) It is deathly simple to sign up and you will get the full power of management system. Please give it a try!

Second,  you can easily complete your comment configuration by just adding your short name into _config.yml:

	duoshuo_username: _your_duoshuo_short_name_
	# OR
	disqus_username: _your_disqus_short_name_
	
Furthermore, Duoshuo support Sharing. if you only wanna use Duoshuo comment without sharing, you can set duoshuo_share: false. You can use Duoshuo Sharing and Disqus Comments together also.

#### Featured Tags

	featured-tags: true  
	featured-condition-size: 1     # A tag will be featured if the size of 	it is more than this condition value

#### Mini About Me

	# Sidebar settings
	sidebar: true
	sidebar-about-description: "your description here"
	sidebar-avatar: avatar-hux.jpg     

Mini-About-Me module display all your SNS buttons also your avatar and the description if you set sidebar-avatar and sidebar-about-description which is very useful and common for a sidebar so it is default with your sidebar.

It is really nice-looking and well-designed. It would be hidden in a small screen seeing the sidebar would be push to bottom and there is already a footer including SNS feature which is similar.

### Post

	---
	layout: post
	title: "Hola 2016"
	subtitle: "hi, I'm haojen ma"
